Job 0: 
        Assembling EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_03.fastq with flye.        
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_03.fasta

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule assemble_flye  in line 55 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
EC2D2/assembly_03 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Removing output files of failed job assemble_flye since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_03.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
