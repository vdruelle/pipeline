Job 1: 
        Reconciling the sub assemblies. 
        Human intervention is needed after this step to judge whether to keep or remove some contigs.
        
Reason: Code has changed since last execution

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule reconcile  in line 16 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakesecond:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Removing output files of failed job reconcile since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001/2_all_seqs.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
