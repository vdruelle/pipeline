Job 0: 
        Converting EC2D2/clusters/contigs.newick to EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt for easier viewing.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt


        nw_display EC2D2/clusters/contigs.newick > EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt
        
[Wed Nov 30 15:24:02 2022]
Error in rule cluster_to_txt:
    jobid: 0
    input: EC2D2/clusters/contigs.newick
    output: EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt
    shell:
        
        nw_display EC2D2/clusters/contigs.newick > EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job cluster_to_txt since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/clusters/contigs_tree.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
