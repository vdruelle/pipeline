Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001/2_all_seqs.fasta

RuleException in rule reconcile  in line 1 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakesecond:
NameError: The name 'cluster_dir' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        trycycler reconcile --reads {input.reads} --cluster_dir {cluster_dir} --threads {threads}
