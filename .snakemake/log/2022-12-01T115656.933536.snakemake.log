Job 1: 
        Reconciling the sub assemblies. 
        Human intervention is needed after this step to judge whether to keep or remove some contigs.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001/2_all_seqs.fasta; Code has changed since last execution

[Thu Dec  1 11:57:44 2022]
Error in rule reconcile:
    jobid: 1
    input: EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001, EC2D2/filtered.fastq
    output: EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001/2_all_seqs.fasta, EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log
    shell:
        
        trycycler reconcile --reads EC2D2/filtered.fastq --cluster_dir EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001 --threads 4         | grep * > EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log
        # > EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log 2>&1 || echo process failed >> EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job reconcile since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/clusters/cluster_001/2_all_seqs.fasta, EC2D2/clusters/Snakesecond.log
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
