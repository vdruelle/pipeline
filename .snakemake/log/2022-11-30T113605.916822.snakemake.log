Job 0: 
        Viewing contig tree generated via clustering from the multiple assemblies.
        Use this to determine if you should exclude some clusters and/or some contigs in these clusters.
        Do so by deleting the relevant folders / files.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/clusters/validated.txt

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule view_contigs  in line 140 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
EC2D2/clusters/validated.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
