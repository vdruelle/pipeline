Job 0: 
        Assembling EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_06.fastq with raven.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_06.fasta

[Tue Nov 29 14:53:33 2022]
Error in rule assemble_raven:
    jobid: 0
    input: EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_06.fastq
    output: EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_06.fasta
    shell:
        
        raven --threads 4 EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_06.fastq > EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_06.fasta
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job assemble_raven since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/assemblies/assembly_06.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
