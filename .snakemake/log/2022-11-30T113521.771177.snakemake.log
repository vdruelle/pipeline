Job 0: 
        Viewing contig tree generated via clustering from the multiple assemblies.
        Use this to determine if you should exclude some clusters and/or some contigs in these clusters.
        Do so by deleting the relevant folders / files.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/clusters/validated.txt

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
