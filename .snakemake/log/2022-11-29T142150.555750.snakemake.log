        Subsampling EC2D2/filtered.fastq in 12 parts.
        
Reason: Missing output files: EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_01.fastq

ImproperOutputException in rule subsample  in line 36 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakefile:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule subsample:
    output: EC2D2/read_subsets, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_01.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_02.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_03.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_04.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_05.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_06.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_07.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_08.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_09.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_10.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_11.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_12.fastq
    wildcards: phage_name=EC2D2
    affected files:
        EC2D2/read_subsets
Removing output files of failed job subsample since they might be corrupted:
EC2D2/read_subsets, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_01.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_02.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_03.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_04.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_05.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_06.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_07.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_08.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_09.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_10.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_11.fastq, EC2D2/read_subsets/sample_12.fastq
Skipped removing non-empty directory EC2D2/read_subsets
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
