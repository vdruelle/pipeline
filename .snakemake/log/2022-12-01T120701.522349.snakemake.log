RuleException in rule reconcile  in line 16 of /home/valentin/Desktop/richardLab/scicore_local/PhD/Phage_project/Sequencing/trycycler/pipeline/Snakesecond:
NameError: The name '1,2' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:

        trycycler reconcile --reads {input.reads} --cluster_dir {input.cluster_dir} --threads {threads}         | sed -r "s/\[([0-9]{{1,2}}(;[0-9]{1,2})?)?[mGK]//g" > {output.logfile} 2>&1         || echo process failed >> {output.logfile}
